        "description": "The Walk to the Sea crosses a terrain that, centuries before, was not land at all, but an active port. Beginning at the State House on Beacon Hill, overlooking the old Boston Common, the Walk passes historic monuments and skyscrapers. From Beacon Hill to Long Wharf, the Walk invites you into a history that is linked to the sea, whose smells and sounds once invaded the city. This one-mile interpretive walk through the heart of Boston gives life to that story.",
